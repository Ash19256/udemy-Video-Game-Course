This is just a repository for segments of code and various data files that I've found useful or that need troubleshooting.
I may also decide to share some of the "function modules" that I intend to create, which are going to be independent pieces of code that
can be called by programs in lieu of using an internal function. This would be more for general purpose things, like a counting function,
rather than anything specialised, the idea being that it woud save time for multiple programs to be able to use the same block of code for
functions in all of the programs. Anyway, feel free to take a look.
